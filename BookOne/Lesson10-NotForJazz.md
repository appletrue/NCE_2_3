Lesson 10  Not for jazz 

【Text】

We have an old musical instrument. It is called a clavichord. It was made in Germany in 1681. Our clavichord is kept in the living room. It has belonged to our family for a long time. The instrument was bought by my grandfather many years ago. Recently it was damaged by a visitor. She tried to play jazz on it! She struck the keys too hard and two of the strings were broken. My father was shocked. Now we are not allowed to touch it. It is being repaired by a friend of my father's.

【课文讲解】

1、It is called a clavichord.

call 在这里的意思是“把……称为”、“称呼”，既可用于主动态，也可用于被动语态。

call sb.sth./sb.be called 称某人为……，什么被称为……

What do you call this? 你们把这称为什么？



2、Our clavichord is kept in the living room. 

It's kept in the living room. That's where we have it.

keep(kept,kept) v. 保持，保存

keep sth.+地点 在某地放……(状态)

put v. 放(动作)；lift v. 举起；carry v. 扛着, 背着, 抱着

hold v. 拥有, 持有, 握着；have v. 拥有 

That's 后面+以特殊疑问词引导的从句

That's where 那就是……的地方

That's why 那就是……的原因 



3、It has belonged to our family for a long time.

belong 是一个表示状态的动词，而不是行为动词，所以不能用于进行时，常用的时态是一般现在时和

现在过去时。

This farm belongs to me and it belonged to my father before me.

4、She tried to play jazz on it!

play n. 玩，演奏（乐器等）

① 跟球类连用, 直接+球类;

② 跟乐器连用, +the+乐器, 演奏乐器而非音乐

③ play music on + 乐器 , 一定要用 “on”



5、Now we are not allowed to touch it. 

We are not allowed to touch it. We mustn't  touch it. 

肯定结构中 must 和 have to 是一个概念；否定结构中 must 和 have to 就不一样了，mustn't:不准, 不可以；

have to 的否定：don't have to 不必(have 实意动词)

You don't have to go to school. 今天你不必去上学

You mustn't go to school. 今天你不许去上学
