## Lesson 18 He often does this!

After I had had lunch at a village pub, I looked for my bag. I had left it on a chair beside the door and now it wasn't there! As I was looking for it, the landlord came in.

'Did you have a good meal?" he asked.

'Yes, thank you,' I answered, 'but I can't pay the bill. I haven't got my bag.'

The landlord smiled and immediately went out. In a few minutes he returned with my bag and gave it back to me.

'I'm very sorry,' he said. 'My dog had taken in into the garden. He often does this!'

### 【课文讲解】

1、After I had had lunch at a village pub, I looked for my bag.

Pub 是 public house（酒店，酒店）的缩写

Let’s go to the pub for a drink.

have 的用法

1、have 作为助动词构成各种完成时和完成进行时

2、have 还可以作完全动词，当作“具有、拥有”讲时，它和 have got 通常可以互换。have 做 “有, 患

病” 概念时, 可作为实义动词, 也可作为非实义动词。在英国英语中的疑问句和否定句中 have（具有）的

用法与 be 相同，即可以不用助动词 do 或 did；在美国英语中，常用 do 助动词和 have 一起构成疑问句

和否定句。

I don’t have a pen/a headache.

I haven’t a pen /a headache.

三种情况 have 可以用 have got 取代

I have a pen. I have got a pen. “有”

I have a headache. I have got a headache. “得病”

have to== have got to

have 作“具有，拥有”讲时是状态动词，不能用于进行时态或被动语态，通常用于一般现在时。在其

它时态中，一般用 have 而不用 have got。

You can have these apples if you want them. I’ve got a lot more.

如果你想要这些苹果你可以把它们拿走。我还有许多。

He must be very fond of animals to have five dogs. 他一定非常喜欢动物，才会养五条狗。

3、have 作完全动词时，还可以表示 eat，drink，enjoy，take 等意思，这时它是行为动词，可以用于包

括进行时的各种时态。当 have 用于表示这些含义时，它必须与助动词 do 等连用以构成疑问句或否定句。

have dinner，have a cigarette，have coffee，have a holiday，have a good time，have a swim，have a rest

2、I had left it on a chair beside the door and now it wasn't there!

leave 除了“离去，离开，出发”的意思，还可以表示“把（人、物）留下，遗留，丢下”等。

Have you left anything in the car?

Beside and Besides

beside pron. 在……旁边，在……附近

Come and sit beside us.

besides adv. 而且，并且，此外；pron. 除……之外（还）

She has so much else to do besides. 此外，她还有许多其他事要做。

I’m quite busy today. Besides, I’ve got a bad cold.

There were a lot of people at the party besides us.

3、In a few minutes he returned with my bag and gave it back to me.

give 的几个固定搭配

give 常用含义是“给予，交给”

I lent him some books last month and he has given them back to me this morning.

gave away 赠送

He gave away all his books to the library.

give in 上交，呈交；屈服，让步，投降

Give in your examination papers after you’ve finished.

You can do what you like. I will never give in.

give up 交出，让出

4、'I'm very sorry,' he said. 'My dog had taken in into the garden. He often does this!'

he 指店主的狗，英语国家人士常用人称代词 he 或 she 指自己喂养的宠物。
