## Lesson 14 Do you speak English? 

I had an amusing experience last year. After I had left a small village in the south of France, I drove on to the next town. On the way, a young man waved to me. I stopped and he asked me for a lift. As soon as he had got into the car, I said good morning to him in French and he replied in the same language. Apart from a few words, I do not know any French at all. Neither of us spoke during the journey. I had nearly reached the town, when the young man suddenly said, very slowly, "Do you speak English?' As I soon learn , he was English himself!'

### 【课文讲解】

1、After I had left a small village in the south of France, I drove on to the next town.

after 引导的从句如果一个是过去时，一个是过去完成时，那一定是从句用过去完成时；before 引导的

从句表示“在……之前”，主句发生在从句之前, 主句用过去完成时。

drive on 继续开往（on 加在动词的后面表示继续）

My heart will go on 《我心永恒》

drive to 开车去某地

副词 on 紧跟在动词后面时可以表示“向前”、“继续下去”等意义：

He talked on until everybody had gone. 他滔滔不绝地讲到大家都走了。

I was reading when my friend called. After he had gone, I went on to read.

我朋友来看我时我正在看书。他走了以后我便继续看书。

表达方位的表达方式一共有 3 个介词, in（在……里面）,on（接壤），to（没有相接的, 是相离的）

A is to the east of B A 在 B 的东方（A 与 B 不相接）

A is on the east of B A 在 B 的东方（A 与 B 接壤）

A is in the east of B A 在 B 的东方（A 在 B 的里面）

2、On the way, a young man waved to me.

on the way 在路上, 在途中

wave to sb. 冲某人挥手

3、As soon as he had got into the car, I said good morning to him in French and he replied in the same language.

as soon as 一……就……，后面一定要加一个句子(时间状语从句), 强调两个动作几乎是连在一起

的，“一” 后面的先发生

As soon as I had entered the room,I took off my coat at once.

As soon as I had received the letter,I ringed/called him back.

只要是状语从句, 一旦遇到将来时, 变为一般现在时

As soon as you arrive,you must call me. 你一到就打我电话

表示用某种语言作为交际手段时介词用 in，表示讲某种语言时可以不加介词。

I speak English. I say a word in Chinese.

That book is written in German.

reply 要想加宾语要加 to (+要回答的内容)，而 in the same language 在句中作状语, 不是 replay 所应回

答的问题(宾语), 故用 in

4、Apart from a few words, I do not know any French at all.

★ Except, Except for 与 Apart from

三者都表示“除……以外”，有时可以互换，但 except 不用于句首，except for 和 apart from 则可以。

Everyone has helped in some way apart from/except for/except you.

Apart from/Except for you, everyone has helped in some way.

apart from 习惯上喜欢放句首, apart from=except/besides

如果认为整体之中做这件事情的人除了整体之外，还有这个人也做了（包括），是加号=besides；如果认为整体之中做这件事情的人除了整体之外，这个人没有做（排除），是减号=except；如果放在句首，统一用 apart from 代替 except/besides

All the passengers are millionaire except us. （减号）

I invited everyone except George. / Except for George I invited everyone.

Except for/apart from this, everything is in order.

except for含有对整体中的某一个方面不满意，except for 可以不放在句首, 强调整体当中某一方面除外,剩下的整体都不错

The article is very good except for his handwriing.

Except for his height, he is very excellent.

Which of，Either of，Neigher of 与 Both of

上面这些短语都可用于指两个人或两件事

either of 两者当中的任何一个

neither of 两者都不

which of 那一个

both of 两者都

当询问在两个或更多的人或事物中偏爱哪一个或选择哪一个时，可用 which

I like both of these bags. Which of the two do you prefer?

either 与 neither 都是对两个人或物而言（后接单数名词）。either 指 one or the other（不是这个就是那个），either 和 neither 后跟 of 时则指两个事物中的每一个

either of sb. ……当中的任何一个

neither of sb. ……当中的任何一个都不（neither of（注意英音与美音的读音）两者之间都不, 一旦出现, 这句话里面不会再出现 not）

I don't like the book. My sister doesn't like it either.

Neither of us likes it. (注意要用单数)

Which bag shall I use?

Either of them. It doesn’t matter which. 哪个都行。用哪个都没关系。

Neither of them. Use a suitcase. 哪个都不行。用个手提箱吧。

both 只指两个人或物。当它用在名词前时，of 可有可无；当用在代词前面时，其后必须加 of

Both books/Both of the books are interesting.

Both of us/them left early.

none of 三者或三者以上之间都不

not … at all 一点都不，表强调

I don't like it.

I don't like it at all.


5、I had nearly reached the town, when the young man suddenly said, very slowly, "Do you speak English?'

nearly 将要

when 的翻译要看当时的具体情况, 在这里译为“就在此时”

I had nearly reached home when I found my mother standing there.

Do you speak English? 你说英语吗? 你是说英语国家的人吗?（问的是一个事实，不是问会说英语吗）

Do you swim? 你去游泳吗?

Can you swim? 你会游泳吗?

6、As I soon learn, he was English himself!'

I learn 我得知； I know 我知道(我本来就知道)

As+主语+动词，从句 （As my mother said/As I heard/ As I learnt） 正如……

As we know,the New Concept English is very good. 正如我们所知……

As I think,it is the coldest day in the year.

As he said, English is easy to learn.

himself 反身代词单独放在句尾, 起强调作用

I read English myself.
