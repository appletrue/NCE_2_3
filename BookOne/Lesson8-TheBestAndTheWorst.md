# Lesson 8 	  The best and the worst 


## 【text】

Joe Sanders has the most beautiful garden in our town. Nearly everybody enters for 'The Nicest Garden Competition' each year, but Joe wins every time. Bill Frith's garden is larger than Joe's. Bill works harder than Joe and grows more flowers and vegetables, but Joe's garden is more interesting. He has made neat paths and has built a wooden bridge over a pool. I like gardens too, but I do not like hard work. Every year I enter for the garden competition too, and I always win a little prize for the worst garden in the town!

## 【课文讲解】

1、Joe Sanders has the most beautiful garden in our town.

Joe's garden is the most beautiful.

Bill's garden is the largest.

Bill’s garden is larger than Joe’s.

（比较的东西都是同类的事物 joe’s 的“’s”不能省略）



2、Joe grows more flowers. More flowers grow in his garden 

grow vt. 种植: grow sth; grow flowers…

vi. 生长: sth. grow; flowers are growing

grow tall/grow big 变得……（一般不加形容词）

grow up 只和人连用, 表示人的长大（up adv.表示向上） 



3、Nearly everybody enters for 'The Nicest Garden Competition' each year, but Joe wins every time.

nearly 和 almost 意义相似，表示“几乎”、“差不多”、“差点儿”的意思。

I have nearly forgotten his name. 我差点把他的名字忘了。

I’m nearly/almost ready. 我快准备好了。

enter for 报名参加（各种竞赛，考试等活动）

defeat+对手

I defeat you.

4、Every year the writer enters for the garden competition  also.

very/also/and/either

very 不单独使用；and 并列连词, 不放在句子末尾；either 也, 表否定

also 表示也, 可以放在句子末尾；often 可以放在句子末尾 

3、Bill Frith's garden is larger than Joe's.

名词加-’s 表示所属关系，构成名词的所有格。这类名词往往指有生命的东西，特别是人。所有格的语法作用相当于形容词，限定后面的名词。这个被限定的名词在上下文中第二次被提到时可以省略，只要不引起误解。

4、He has made neat paths and has built a wooden bridge over a pool.

make 和 build 在这里是同义词，“修建，建造”。make 的词义比较笼统、广泛，可解释为“做、作出、制造”等，而 build 主要限于建筑业，指“建造，建设，盖房子，修筑（桥梁）等”

Have you made the skirt by yourself?

They have made a road along the river.



The plane was late and detectives were waiting at the airport all morning. 

They were expecting a valuable parcel of diamonds from South Africa. 

A few hours earlier, someone had told the police that thieves would try to steal the diamonds. 

When the plane arrived, some of the detectives were waiting inside the main building while others were waiting on the airfield. 

Two men took the parcel off the plane and carried it into the Customs House. 

While two detectives were keeping guard at the door, two others opened the parcel. 

To their surprise, the precious parcel was full of stones and sand!
