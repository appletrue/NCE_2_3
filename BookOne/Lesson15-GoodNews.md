Lesson 15 Good news 

The secretary told me that Mr. Harmsworth would see me. I felt very nervous when I went into his office. He did not look up from his desk when I entered. After I had sat down, he said that business was very bad. He told me that the firm could not afford to pay such large salaries. Twenty people had already left. I knew that my turn had come.
'Mr.Harmsworth,' I said in a weak voice.
'Don't interrupt,' he said.
Then he smiled and told me I would receive an extra thousand pounds a year!

### 【课文讲解】

1、The secretary told me that Mr. Harmsworth would see me.

would 在这里不是表示单纯的过去将来时，而是表示“想……”、“要……”的意思：

What would you like to have?

John wouldn’t lend me his bicycle.

2、He did not look up from his desk when I entered.

look up 表示原先在埋头干什么，之后抬头看

He looked up (from his book) when he heard a noise.

look down 往地上看（look up 的反义词）

look down upon/on sb. 瞧不起某人

I look down upon my sister.

3、After I had sat down, he said that business was very bad.

Business is very good! 生意好!

4、He told me that the firm could not afford to pay such large salaries.

collect salary 领薪水

pay salary 支付薪水

large 一般指东西的数量大

so 的后面加形容词或副词；such 的后面加名词, 容许在该名词前面加修饰词

5、I knew that my turn had come.

turn n. 轮流，轮班，（依次轮流时各自的）一次机会

My turn has come.

It is my turn. 轮到我了(口语常用形式)

When his turn came, he couldn’t speak any word.

6、'Mr.Harmsworth,' I said in a weak voice.

in a … voice 用……的声音

in a loud(大声)/low (低声)/weak(强调心里不踏实)/strong(理直气壮) voice

7、Then he smiled and told me I would receive an extra thousand pounds a year!

以下几个词都可表示 “再, 又” 的意思, 注意用法 :

① an extra thousand(作名词看)

数量+extra+名词 再有多少

On Sundays, I usually get some extra sleep.

Last month, he was paid an extra hundred pounds.

② two others = two other +名词

③ two more

Give me two extra/other/more books. 再给我两本书。

once more: 再一次

④ another three days 另外三天（只有 another 的数词在后面）
