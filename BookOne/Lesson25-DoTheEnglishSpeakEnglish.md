Lesson 25 Do the English speak English?

I arrived in London at last. The railway station was big, black and dark. I did not know the way to my hotel,

so I asked a porter. I not only spoke English very carefully, but very clearly as well. The porter, however, could

not understand me. I repeated my question several times and at last he understood. He answered me, but he spoke neither slowly nor clearly. 'I am a foreigner,' I said. Then he spoke slowly, but I could not understand him. My teacher never spoke English like that! The porter and I looked at each other and smiled. Then he said something and I understood it. 'You'll soon learn English!' he said. I wonder. In England, each person speaks a different language. The English understand each other, but I don't understand them! Do they speak English?

【课文讲解】

1、Do the English speak English?

English 这里均为名词，第一个指“英国人”，前面要加 the，表示一个群体，后面的动词必须用复数；

第二个指“英语”，指语言时前面不加冠词。

The English often talk about the weather.

English 还可以作形容词，表示“英格兰的，英国的，英国人的”等。

与 English 相似的单词有 French，Chinese，Japanese 等。

2、I arrived in London at last.

arrive vi. 到达

arrive at 小地点；arrive in 大地点

When will you arrive?

reach vt. 到达……（后面一定要加宾语）

When will you reach(arrive in) BeiJing?

get to+宾语 到达……

When will you get to BeiJing?

How can I get there?

home/there 都是副词，副词跟动词连用的时候不需要加介词，arrive 也一样；但一般不用“reach

home/there”，如一定要这样写则把“home”看作名词，“there”当代词看, 不作副词看

get home 到家；get there 到那
