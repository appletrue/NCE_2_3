Lesson 2 Breakfast or lunch? 

It was Sunday. I never get up early on Sundays. I sometimes stay in bed until lunchtime. Last Sunday I got up very late. I looked out of the window. It was dark outside. What a day!I thought. It's raining again. Just then, the telephone rang. It was my aunt Lucy. I've just arrived by train, she said. I'm coming to see you. 

But I'm still having breakfast, I said.

What are you doing?she asked.

I'm having breakfast, I repeated.

Dear me, she said. Do you always get up so late? It's one o'clock!



Notes on the text 课文注释

1 on Sundays，指每个星期日。星期几的前面用介词on。

2 What a day！多么糟糕的天气！这是一个省略的感叹句。完整的句子应该是What a day it is！英语中的感叹句常用what开头，后面紧跟一个名词或名词性短语(包括连系动词)，然后是主语和谓语，句尾用感叹号。

3 I'm coming to see you．在这句话中现在进行时用来表示近期按计划或安排要进行的动作。

4 Dear me！天哪！这也是一个感叹句。
