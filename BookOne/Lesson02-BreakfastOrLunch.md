7、Dear me!

### 【Special Difficulties】

 What a day！多么糟糕的天气！

这是一个省略的感叹句。完整的句子应该是What a day it is！

以 what 开头的感叹句:

英语中的感叹句常用what开头，后面紧跟一个名词或名词性短语(包括连系动词)，然后是主语和谓语，句尾用感叹号。 

 在英语中可用 what 引导的感叹句来表示惊奇、愤怒、赞赏、喜悦等感情，在感叹中主谓语采用正常语序。

 What 对名词感叹，感叹句的结构为:What +a/an (+adj.)+n.(+主语+谓语)! 

What a good girl (she is)! (主、谓可省)

 有上下文和一定的语境, 才能省略形容词。**一般省略形容词表示批评或不大好的意思。** 

What a thing to say! 多么难听的话啊! 

What (a lot of) trouble( he is causing)!
