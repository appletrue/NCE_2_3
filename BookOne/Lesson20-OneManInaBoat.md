Lesson 20 One man in a boat

Fishing is my favourite sport. I often fish for hours without catching anything. But this does not worry me. Some fishermen are unlucky. Instead of catching fish, they catch old boots and rubbish. I am even less lucky. I never catch anything -- not even old boots. After having spent whole mornings on the river, I always go home with an empty bag. 'You must give up fishing!' my friends say. 'It's a waste of time.' But they don't realize one important thing. I'm not really interested in fishing. I am only interested in sitting in a boat and doing nothing at all!

【课文讲解】

1、Fishing is my favourite sport.

fishing 是一个动名词，由动词+ing 组成，动名词可以作主语或宾语，如 eating，reading 等等

★fish

① n. 鱼（不可数名词），鱼的种类（可数）

There are a lot of fishes(表示种类)in the sea.

② v. 钓鱼, 捕鱼



2、I often fish for hours without catching anything.

for+时间 表示一段时间

for hours=for some hours 数小时

without catching anything 作为状语而出现, 表示结果状语。without 是介词，后面一定要加宾语, 动名词catching 作 without 的宾语，without 后面的动作是主语来做的。动名词也有动词的特性，可以有自己的宾语。

without 通常表示“缺乏、没有”；当它位于动名词前时，表示“不曾、不”

I can’t repair the car without your help.

They tried to leave the restaurant without paying.

He went out without saying any words.



3、But this does not worry me.

★	worry

- v. 烦恼，担扰

worry sb. 某人为……烦恼，担扰（作动词一定要加人作宾语, 翻译时从后往前翻，宾语担心）

The house worried me. / My daughter worried me.

- adj. 担心

be worried about ……为……担心

I was never worried about this. = This does not worry me.



4、Instead of catching fish, they catch old boots and rubbish.

instead of… 我原准备做……但是后来做了……（instead of 后面的词一定是没有做的, 可以放在主句后面）

I went to school instead of staying at home. 我没呆在家里而是去上学了

I bought books instead of buying dresses.

without 强调没有做某件事, instead of 强调这件事没做成而做成了另外一件事

副词 instead“作为替代，反而”，单独使用时一般出现在句尾

If you don’t want a holiday in England, why don’t you go to Australia instead?



5、I am even less lucky.

less 是 little 的比较级，意为“不及，不如，更少”

I spend less time on English than on French.

less+原形

A is less…than B A 不如 B



6、After having spent whole mornings on the river, I always go home with an empty bag.

spend+时间+在某地 在某地度过……时间

after <conj.>+从句 在……之后

after <prep.>+名词/动词的 ing 形式 ……之后（从句主语必须是主句的主语时两种形式可互换）

After I go to school, I learned a lot of knowledge. (用一般式表示一个事实, 不用 “went to” )

After going to school, I learned a lot of knowledge.

介词 after 的宾语的动名词 having spent 所表示的动作发生在谓语动词 go 之前，所以动名词用完成形式。

with an empty bag 注意连读

with sth. 有……的，持有……的，随身带着……(状语)

Who’s the man with the beard?

without sth. 没带……

I always go home without angthing. 什么都没带回家

go home 习惯用法

go to the house 语法正确

没有规则与语法相提并论时，语法为大；语法与习惯用法相提并论时，习惯用法为大。

Where are you going? (更习惯这么说)

Where are you going to?



7、But they don't realize one important thing. 

Realize and Understand

realize vt. 意识到……

He didn't realize that he had made a mistake. 他没有意识到他犯了一个错误.

understand vt. 明白……

I don't understand English. 我不懂英语.

8、'You must give up fishing!' my friends say.

give up doing sth. = stop doing sth. 放弃做某事

Give up smoking.

9、I'm not really interested in fishing.

be intersted in sth. / doing sth. 对……感兴趣

I’m interested in collecting stamps.

Interested and Interesting. Excited and Exciting.

大多数现在分词和许多过去分词都可以作形容词用。

- 以-ed 结尾的形容词常与人称主语连用，表示人的情绪、状态、喜好等；
- 以-ing 结尾的形容词则常与非人称主语连用，表明事物的某种特征、性质等。

interested adj. 感兴趣的 ；interesting adj. 有趣的

excited adj. 感动的 ；exciting adj. 令人激动的

如果–ed,-ing 做形容词即作定语时，和被修饰词有关

Fishing is not interesting. I am not really interested in fishing.

钓鱼没意思. 我对钓鱼并不真正感兴趣.

The match was very exciting. The crowd got very excited.

比赛非常激动人心. 观众非常激动.

He is an explorer. He leads an (excited) (exciting) life.

explorer n.探险家, 探测者, 探测器

lead a life 过着……日子
