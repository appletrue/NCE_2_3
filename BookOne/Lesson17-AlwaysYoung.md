Lesson 17 Always young 

My aunt Jennifer is an actress. She must be at least thirty-five years old. In spite of this, she often appears on
the stage as a young girl. Jennifer will have to take part in a new play soon. This time, she will be a girl of
seventeen. In the play, she must appear in a bright red dress and long black stockings. Last year in another play,
she had to wear short socks and a bright, orange-coloured dress. If anyone ever asks her how old she is, she
always answers, 'Darling, it must be terrible to be grown up!'
