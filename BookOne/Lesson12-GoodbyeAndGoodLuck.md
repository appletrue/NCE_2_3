## Lesson 12  Goodbye and good luck 

Our neighbour, Captain Charles Alison, will sail from Portsmouth tomorrow. We'll meet him at the harbour early in the morning. He will be in his small boat, Topsail. Topsail is a famous little boat. It has sailed across the Atlantic many times. Captain Alison will set out at eight o'clock, so we'll have plenty of time. We'll see his boat and then we'll say goodbye to him. He will be away for two months. We are very proud of him. He will take part in an important race across the Atlantic.

### 【课文讲解】

1、We'll meet him at the harbour early in the morning.

在表示时间的短语 in the morning，in the afternoon 等前面可以再加上 early，late 等副词，以便确切地表示时间

early in the morning 一大早

late in the afternoon 傍晚

2、It has sailed across the Atlantic many times.

across 是对某个细长物“横切、横断、横渡”等，尤指河流、马路、海洋等；过桥用 over

the Atlantic =the Atlantic Ocean 大西洋

once，twice，three times…

表示次数的时候, for 一定不能加

I do something twice.

3、Captain Alison will set out at eight o'clock, so we'll have plenty of time.

set out/set off/begin something 出发，动身

plenty =enough 相对多，充足的，足够的

plenty of 足够多的……

I have plenty of money.

a lot of 指客观上的多

4、We'll see his boat and then we'll say goodbye to him.

see = visit 参观

Can I see it?

say goodbye (to sb.)；say hello to (to sb.)；say sorry to (to sb.)

I said hello to him this morning.

You must say sorry to somebody.

5、He will be away for two months.

**瞬间动词不是不能用完成时态, 而是指不能与段时间连用, 一旦要用段时间就要将其变为 “系表结构”,即 “be + 形容词或介词短语构成” **

He has been away for two hours.

=He left two hours ago.点时间

有的动词可用 be+形容词系表结构表状态来代替

arrive= be here/there ；leave= be away ；die = be dead ；

join(也是瞬间动词) = be a soldier/in the army

**== be+副词构成的表语**

动词 be 如与不同的副词连用意义不同，意思主要由副词的意义决定：

be in 在家；be out 出去；be away 离开；be back 回来；

be on 上映；be over 结束；

be up to sth.胜任某件事情, 能够做某件事


6、He will take part in an important race across the Atlantic.

take part (in) 参加，参与（某项活动）

enter for 报名参加

I have entered for the meeting,but now I don't want to take part in the meeting.

an important race across the Atlantic 横渡大西洋的比赛（介词短语做定语放在被修饰词的后面）

the person at the door

be in the race = take part in the race 参加比赛

at the race 在比赛场地观看比赛
