## Lesson 1 A private conversation 私人谈话

Last week I went to the theatre. I had a very good seat. The play was very interesting. I did not enjoy it. A young man and a young woman were sitting behind me. They were talking loudly. I got very angry. I could not
hear the actors. I turned round. I looked at the man and the woman angrily. They did not pay any attention. In the end, I could not bear it. I turned round again. "I can't hear a word!" I said angrily.
"It's none of your business," the young man said rudely. "This is a private conversation!"

【课文讲解】

1、Last week I went to the theatre.
动词 go 的原义是离开一个地方去另一个地方，与介词 to 连用后，常加上主语所要去的目的来代表主
语的动作目的。

**go to the +地点 表示去某地干嘛**

go to the theatre = go to the theatre to see a play 去剧场看戏

go to the cinema =see a film 去电影院看电影

go to the dairy 去牛奶店

go to the + 人 + 's 表示去这个人开的店

go to the doctor's 去看病；

go to the butcher's 买肉

以下短语中名词前不加冠词：

go to school 去上学；

go to church 去做礼拜；

go to hospital(医院) 去看病；

go to bed 上床，睡觉；

go home（跟 home 相连一定表示没有事情可做,回家休息）

I am at home. 在家休息

2、I had a very good seat.
seat 一般指戏院、汽车等配置的固定座位，也可以抽象地表示“座位”或“位子”等概念。

the front seat of a car 汽车的前座
Take a seat, please. 请坐。

3、I did not enjoy it.

enjoy vt. 欣赏，享受，喜爱

① enjoy +n. 喜欢,从当中得到一种享受（后面不能跟人）
I enjoy the music.
enjoy the dinner/film/program/game

② enjoy oneself/代词 玩的开心
We always enjoy ourselves.

③ enjoy +动名词
Jane doesn’t enjoy swimming. She enjoys going to the theatre.

4、I got very angry.

get 在这里有“逐渐变得”的含义，接近 become，是个表示过程的动词，表示状态的变化。而 I was very
angry 则仅表示当时的状态是生气，并不暗示过程。

I am/was angry. 是一个事实
I got angry. 强调变化过程
It is hot.
It got hot.
got 取代 be 动词，got 是一个半联系动词,可以直接加形容词。

5、I could not hear the actors. I turned round.
hear+人:听见某人的话

I could not hear you. Beg your pardon?
I couldn't hear you./I couldn't hear a word./I couldn't catch your words.
I couldn't hear you clearly./I couldn't catch your words.
Beg your pardon? /I couldn't catch your words.
turn round =turn around 转身

6、In the end, I could not bear it.

in the end 最后，终于，表示一段较长的时间之后或某种努力之后

She tried hard to finish her homework by herself. In the end, she had to ask her brother for help.
I could not bear it/you/the noise.

7、I can't hear a word!

美音:肯定 I can 否定,I can't, 它的/t/是吞进去的, 在读音上很难区别, 只能根据上下文来定
hear a word of sb. （a word 等于一句话）
He didn't say a word.
May I speak to Jim?/May I have a word with Jim?

8、It's none of your business.

one’s business 指某人（所关心的或份内）的事

It's none of your business./None of your business./It's my business. 不关你的事。
It is my business to look after your health. 我必须照顾你的身体健康。

none 相当于 not any 或 no one，但语气较强。

She kept none of his letters. 他的信件她一封也没有保留。

none of 这个短语有时可以表达一种断然、甚至粗暴的口气，尤其是在祈使句中：

None of your silly remarks! 别说傻话了！
